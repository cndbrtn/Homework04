// Let's make a quiz! About JavaScript!

// First we need a timer
    // that timer needs to count down with the ability to remove time based on user input

// Then we need to keep score
    // score is modified by user input based on correct or incorrect answers
        // 10 questions worth max 10 points each to = 100

// We need an event to start the game!

// We need a series of questions

 // questions

    // followed by events to track answers given via radio dial button thingie?

    // Then conditions to give points for correct answers

    // Or penalties for incorrect answers

// Once complete we need something spit out score!

// And finally something to store the user's score locally!

var str = "What the fucking fuckity fuck?"
