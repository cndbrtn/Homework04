## Quiz Description

This quiz starts with a call to action, inviting the user to 
click the 'Start!!!' button which brings them to the next screen. 
There the user is provided two choices, one for a quiz on some basic JavaScript, the other a quiz about the maker's pets. Once a quiz is selected a 
timer starts, indicating the user has a limited time to complete the quiz. 

There are five questions per quiz, each worth 20 points. If the user chooses a 
correct answer they hear a ding, are awarded 20 points, and move on to the next question. If they choose incorrectly they hear a buzz, have 10 points deducted from their score and move on to the next question.

When the quiz is completed or the user times out they arrive at the GAME OVER screen with their final score displayed, followed by a prompt to enter their initials to store their score. They are then given the option to play again.

Ta da!
